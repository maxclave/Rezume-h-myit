  <p>Hi, I'm a game developer with two years of experience. I am proficient in the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. Also, my stack includes languages such as html, css, javascript, php, python, c++. I own them at a basic level. I studied Unreal Engine and hope to switch to it in the future to create serious game projects such as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Outlast and Mortal Kombat.</p><p>I am currently studying at the International University of Information Technology, majoring in computing technologies and software. In addition, I work as a chief programmer at <a href="https://sinomigames.com/">Sinomi Games</a>.</p><p>How did I come to this? At the age of 16, I started studying programming, namely python at school. We were given the task to make some kind of game through the pygame library, and it was at that moment that I realized what I would do in the future, namely programming. I switched from python to Unity pretty quickly, for the reason that it was the best of its kind for me at that time. But after 2 months of training, I was tormented by doubts and I decided to switch to web development. At that time, this industry seemed to be the most persective. After studying html/css/js for another 3 months, I posted my vacancy on freelancehunt, also indicating that I own Unity. Due to the fact that I did not understand exactly how to communicate there, I never offered my candidacy to customers and, as I thought, the vacancy died, but a miracle happened. 3 months after I stopped doing all this, our former designer wrote to me (verbatim quote): "Hello Maxim. I found your resume on the freelance hunt. Are you interested in cooperation in the field of game development?" and then a pathetic intro like in a Hollywood movie. I think it was a key factor in my life that changed everything. I am very grateful for this opportunity and will not let down those who gave it to me. The rest of the story is not particularly interesting, hard work and a cup of coffee helped me gain skills that I use to this day.</p><p>Recently, I have a question, what will I do when I bring our project to a logical conclusion? I understand that I will support him for a long time so that he constantly improves, but I think only 10% of the forces that I spend now will be spent on this. Therefore, in the future I want to open my own game development studio, and I will take people like me at the beginning of the journey, aimlessly floating in this sea called life. I am eager to give them the same opportunity that I got myself. Give a goal, add motivation and grow aspiration.</p>
  <h4>Best Regards,<br>Galinskiy Maxim</h4>
